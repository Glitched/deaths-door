# Blood on the Clocktower — A Practical Rules Guide (Markdown Edition)

> This version condenses and clarifies the official docs so a new group can learn by reading it aloud. Storyteller notes and best-practice tips are included as callouts.

---

## 0) What This Game Is

- Social deduction for 5–15+ players set in **Ravenswood Bluff**.
- Secret teams:
  - **Good (blue):** find and execute the **Demon**.
  - **Evil (red):** protect the Demon and mislead the town.
- **Good wins** when the **Demon dies**.
- **Evil wins** if **only 2 players remain alive** (night kills will then end it), or if victory is otherwise certain.

---

## 1) Structure of Play

- The game alternates between **Night** and **Day**.
- **At Night**: most players close eyes; some wake to act or learn info.
- **By Day**: free discussion, private chats allowed; ends with **nominations and a possible execution**.

> **Storyteller:** When teaching, demonstrate the night hand-signals as you explain them.

---

## 2) Night Hand-Signals (demonstrate while explaining)

- **Wake up:** two firm taps on shoulder/knee ⇒ *open eyes*.
- **Sleep:** flat palm gesture ⇒ *close eyes*.
- **Yes / No:** nod / shake head.
- **Good / Evil:** thumbs-up / thumbs-down (or pre-agreed signs).
- **Numbers:** count with fingers (0, 1, 2, 3…).
- **Choosing a player:** point clearly at the target.
- **Confirming a choice (best practice):** Storyteller stands above the indicated player and points straight down. Player nods to confirm.

> **Keep movement patterns varied** at night so footsteps don’t leak information. Tap quietly; if clothing blocks taps, press twice firmly.

---

## 3) Four Rules to Remember (read aloud)

1. **Say anything, anytime.** Publicly or in private—lying is allowed.
2. **No peeking.** Keep your token secret. Never look in the **Grimoire**.
3. **Ask questions.** The Storyteller is neutral and can answer privately.
4. **Play nice.** Deceive in game; respect in life. Kill with grace; die with dignity.

---

## 4) Death, Drunk, and Poison

- **Death isn’t the end.** Dead players:
  - Keep talking.
  - Still win/lose with their team.
  - **Cannot nominate** and have **exactly one vote** total for the rest of the game.
  - **Lose their ability immediately** (unless the ability says otherwise).
- **Drunk/Poisoned** players:
  - **Have no ability** (their power fails).
  - The Storyteller **pretends** they do—misleading info may be given.
  - Turn their reminder tokens **upside-down** (optional tracking); remove or restore as sobriety/health changes.

> Example: If Poisoner poisons the Slayer, and the Poisoner dies later that night, the Slayer is no longer poisoned (persistent effects end when the source dies).

---

## 5) Day: Nominations & Executions

- The Storyteller says: **“I’m calling for nominations.”**
- To nominate: “**I nominate _Bob_.**”
- The Storyteller starts the vote: **“Votes for _Bob_, starting now.”** They sweep clockwise; a raised hand when the Storyteller points to you = **vote**.
- **You may vote as often or as little as you like each day** (alive players only), but **dead players** each have **one total vote** in the entire game—spend it wisely.
- **Execution result:**
  - Player with **most votes** is executed **if** votes ≥ **50% of current living players**.
  - **Ties**: nobody is executed.
  - If **no execution**, proceed to Night.

> **End-early guidance:** With **4 alive**, if a non-Demon is executed, you generally can end (night kill → 3 alive → evil win trajectory). **Don’t** end if characters like **Monk/Soldier** could prevent death that night.

---

## 6) Abilities — Ground Rules

- **Text hierarchy:** Character **almanac** > token/sheet wording > **night sheet order** (which is only a wake-order guide).
- **Timing:** “When used, abilities happen immediately.”
  - If Demon kills Fortune Teller before they act, Fortune Teller **does not** later act that night.
  - If Monk protects Empath before Demon acts, Empath **does not** die this night.
- **Only tell players what their ability grants.**
  - You generally **do not** announce causes of death, protections, failed Slays, or role changes (e.g., Scarlet Woman becoming the Demon).
- **Death / drunk / poison ends abilities immediately**, removing persistent effects (and related reminders). Some abilities explicitly function **“even if dead”** or **on death**—those still apply.
- **“Choose” vs. “is chosen”:**
  - If an ability says **“choose”**, the **player** chooses.
  - If it says **“a player is…”** without “choose,” the **Storyteller** chooses.
- **Incorrect usage:** If a player makes an illegal choice, correct it (shake head at night; explain by day) and have them choose again.
- **Becoming a new character:**
  - Gain the new ability **immediately**; lose the old ability and its effects.
  - “Once per game” resets for the new role.
  - “First night only” effects fire **that night**.
  - Midgame transformations to Minion/Demon **do not** retro-teach evil teammates.
  - **Square-bracket [setup] text** on tokens is **ignored** midgame.
- **Off-order resolutions:** If you forgot an immediate trigger, resolve it as soon as you remember; keep night sheet for wake order, not rules precedence.

## 7) Setting Up a Game (Storyteller)

### 7.1 Room & Seating
- One chair per player in a circle/square with a clear clockwise order.
- Leave a **gap** for the Storyteller to enter/exit the circle.
- Keep the center **clear** (no tripping hazards).

### 7.2 Prepare the Grimoire
- Clip the box into a **book-like Grimoire**; place on its **stand** where passersby won’t see inside.
- Collect **info**, **night**, and **shroud** tokens together (e.g., bottom-left of right page).
- **Hold** the Grimoire by the center pillar; keep it **level** when moving. Transport spine-down.

### 7.3 Choose an Edition
- Core set editions: **Trouble Brewing** (5+), **Bad Moon Rising** (7+), **Sects & Violets** (7+).
- For early groups, start with **Trouble Brewing** and 5–10 players.
- Place the edition **night sheet** on the right side.

### 7.4 Prepare the Town Square
- Board in the middle; seat-matched **life tokens** around it.
- Pile of **vote tokens** in center.
- Slide **Traveller sheet** partially under the board to show **#Townsfolk / Outsiders / Minions**.

### 7.5 Read the Rules (to new players)
- Use this guide. Demonstrate hand-signals.
- Consider delaying the **nominations/executions** explanation until the first nomination happens—players retain it better.

### 7.6 Secretly Choose Characters
- From the edition’s tokens, select the counts shown on the **setup sheet** for your player count.
- Keep unused tokens hidden; players **should not** know the exact characters in play.
- If **>15 players**, extras join as **Travellers** (powerful, flexible, may expedite play). For first games, **skip** Travellers and Fabled.

> **Example beginner scripts (8 players):**
>
> - **Talky & forgiving:** Chef, Empath, Fortune Teller, Undertaker, Virgin, Drunk (as Investigator), Scarlet Woman, Imp.
> - **Quiet & tense:** Empath, Fortune Teller, Ravenkeeper, Slayer, Mayor, Saint, Poisoner, Imp.
> - **Logic-heavy:** Washerwoman, Fortune Teller, Undertaker, Slayer, Virgin, Recluse, Spy, Imp.

### 7.7 Orange Flowers: Add/Remove Characters (Setup Modifiers)
- Some tokens display an **orange flower** and bracketed setup text **[like this]** that **immediately** alters counts before game start.
  - Example: **Baron**: **[+2 Outsiders]** ⇒ add 2 Outsiders, remove 2 Townsfolk.
- After adjustments, **#tokens = #players**.

### 7.8 Add Reminder Tokens
- Tokens with **green leaves** indicate how many **reminders** to add to the Grimoire for that character.
  - Example: **Investigator** token and its reminders share a magnifying glass icon.

### 7.9 Pass Out Character Tokens
- Shuffle selected tokens into the **bag**; each player draws **one in secret**.

### 7.10 Place Tokens in the Grimoire
- Collect face-down from each player (felt side up) and lay them into the Grimoire matching **seating order** (group physically clustered players if helpful, but preserve clockwise order).

---

## 8) Storyteller Craft — Running Smoothly

- **Confirm night choices** with the vertical point-down method.
- **Mimic fake actions** when evil bluffs (move tokens as if real) so veterans can’t read your hands.
- **Answer questions privately** when they could leak roles; publicly, reference **player names** not **roles**.
- **Discourage pre-first-night role reveals** (or use Fabled **Hell’s Librarian**) so Demon still gets clean bluff options.
- **Keep players near the circle** to make nominations efficient and encourage cross-table chats.
- **Admit mistakes; don’t “balance” by compensating the other side.**
  - If you skipped a wake (e.g., Butler), you may briefly **re-sleep** the group to fix it or resolve in a **private chat** with that player.
- **Pace over perfection:** relax; take your time to reduce errors.

> **Fair Endings:** Declare victory early only if the losing side truly has **no outs**. If any path exists (even unlikely), continue.

---

## 9) Making It Fun

- **Execution flair:** Ask the condemned, “**How would you like to die?**” Keep responses brief, playful, and group-appropriate.
- **Narrate as much or as little as you like.** Atmosphere is optional; players generate most of the fun.
- **Don’t break structural rules** (counts, roles, Demon presence). If info is unreliable, players must be able to **know that** (via drunk/poison), not suffer hidden rule changes.
- **Let players own their choices.** Don’t steer “odd” targets; surprises often have logic.
- **Manage negativity** privately; address tone/behavior, not person. Protect psychological safety; ban repeat bullies until behavior changes.
- **Taboos & comfort:** Curate scripts to avoid specific triggers if needed; the **Fabled** can help shape meta conditions.
- **Support shy players** by granting the floor at natural moments (e.g., after they’re nominated). If you must silence, **silence everyone**, not just the talkative.
- **Aim for a final-day climax** (3–4 alive). Invisible, within-rules nudges (how you resolve drunk info, which registrations occur) can help the weaker team without deciding the game for them.
- **Honor evil bluffs:** If Imp claims Slayer and “fires,” treat it with equal ceremony (it simply doesn’t work).
- **Celebrate wins** with a dramatic reveal; invite high-fives/hugs.
- **Creativity welcome** (texting, unusual social gambits) as long as it stays in-game, fair, and fun. No real-world bribery or coercion.

---

## 10) The Script (Custom Character Lists)

- After learning the core editions, build custom scripts at **script.bloodontheclocktower.com** (mix any characters you own; it will generate a night sheet).
- **Travellers** can be added to suit the group; decide suitability per script.
- **Fabled** adjust the game’s meta (outsider counts, extra misinformation, silence, inclusivity aids).
- **Weird interactions happen.** When ambiguous, **rule clearly and announce you’re making a ruling**; consistency beats perfection.
- **Teensyville** variant: small scripts for **5–6 players** to sharpen deduction (fewer characters on the sheet; easier mapping).

---

## 11) Growing Your Group

- Create/join local groups (FB/Meetup/etc.).
- **Encourage players to Storytell**; mentor them for a game or two.
- **Lead kindly:** schedule, be welcoming, and especially support newcomers.
- **Keep it simple for new players:** rules sheet + play; let strategy accrete over time.
- **Targeted help for beginners:** explain **why** roles like **Ravenkeeper** and **Virgin** are powerful rather than prescribing moves.
- **Use Travellers** to let latecomers join.
- **Use Fabled** to include more player types (Angel, Revolutionary, Buddhist, etc.).

---

## 12) Quick Reference (Table-Talk Friendly)

- **Teams:** Good (blue) vs Evil (red). Kill the Demon vs run down the clock to 2 alive.
- **Day:** free talk; nominations; **execute highest votes ≥ 50% of living**; ties = no execution.
- **Night:** close eyes; Storyteller wakes roles in order; use signals; confirm choices vertically.
- **Dead players:** still talk; **1 vote**, no nominations, lose ability unless text says otherwise.
- **Drunk/Poison:** ability fails; Storyteller may lie/mislead accordingly.
- **Abilities:** fire immediately; almanac trumps sheet; night sheet = wake order guide.
- **Storyteller ethics:** no secret rule changes; fix mistakes cleanly; don’t compensate; keep it fun and fair.

### Appendix A — Teaching Script Snippets (Read-Aloud Seeds)

**Opening flavor (optional):**
> “A long time ago, in Ravenswood Bluff, during a hellish storm… the Storyteller lies impaled on the clocktower’s hour hand. A Demon stalks by night, wearing human form by day.”

**Nominations spiel:**
> “To nominate, say ‘I nominate ___.’ I’ll call, ‘Votes for ___, starting now,’ and sweep clockwise. Hand up when I point to you = vote. Most votes **and** at least half of the living ⇒ executed. Ties: no execution.”

**Death reassurance:**
> “If you die, you still play, still win with your team, and keep one precious vote. Many roles get stronger through death.”

---

### Appendix B — Handling Common Confusions

- **“Why didn’t my ability work?”**  
  Could be timing, protection, wrong target type, or **you were drunk/poisoned**. The Storyteller won’t confirm which.
- **“Do we learn causes of death?”**  
  No—only **who died**, not how.
- **“Do I keep protecting after I die?”**  
  No—abilities end unless explicitly “even if dead” or “on death”.
- **“Midgame role change: do I meet evil?”**  
  No—evil team info is only given at game start.
